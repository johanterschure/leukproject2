           <h2>About Kaasch</h2>
			The reason behind creating the webshop Kaasch is because of our love for cheese. We saw a gap in the cheese market
			namely that not everyone can enjoy all the delicious Dutch cheese outside of the Netherlands.
			To find a solution created the webshop Kaasch, Dutch cheese to anyone outside of the Netherlands. This way everyone can enjoy the best and the finest Dutch cheeses.
			The current situation is that there aren't any good webshops where consumers outside of the Netherlands can order Dutch cheeses.
			Our target group are mainly young households; men and women from 18 years of age who live outside of the Netherlands,
			with a great interest for all kinds of various cheese. Most cheese eaters who order primarily online are the young Households.
			The problem that the webshop solves is the difficult import of Dutch cheese using an accessible website.<br>
